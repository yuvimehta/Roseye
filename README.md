# Roseye - ROS Interface

Roseye is an intuitive interface designed for use in ROS (Robot Operating System) projects. It provides a convenient way to manage and interact with nodes, as well as access visual data and monitor sensor information. 

## Features

- **Node Management**: Run and kill nodes seamlessly through the Roseye interface.
- **Visual Data**: View real-time visuals from the image topics, sourced from either a simulator or a physical camera.
- **Sensor Data**: Monitor sensor information, such as lidar data, in a dedicated sensor data window.
- **Terminal Integration**: Keep track of warning and error messages with a built-in terminal window.

## Project Status

This project is currently under development, with progress being made towards its completion. The current functionality allows for video feed display from the image topic and the ability to run and kill nodes using the interface.
## Future Enhancements

In the future, I am planning to introduce remote access features, enabling wireless control of the interface from a different machine. This enhancement will further enhance the flexibility and accessibility of the Roseye interface.
